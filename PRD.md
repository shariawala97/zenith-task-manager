- **Customization**: Allow users to adjust UI density or theme preferences for a more personalized experience.

## User Experience

### Entry Point & First-Time User Experience
- Users discover Zenith via a clean landing page or direct app link.
- First-time users are greeted with a 2-step onboarding overlay:
  - Step 1: "Welcome to Zenith – Your minimalist task manager."
  - Step 2: "Add your first task below. All features are one click away."
- Onboarding can be dismissed or completed in under 30 seconds.

### Core Experience
1. **Step 1**: User lands on the main dashboard with a prominent "Add Task" input.
   - Minimal UI: Only essential elements visible, no clutter.
   - Input is auto-focused for immediate typing.
   - Validation: Prevent empty tasks; show subtle error if attempted.

2. **Step 2**: User adds a task, optionally sets due date and category.
   - Categories selectable via dropdown or quick-type.

3. **Step 3**: User marks a task as complete.
   - Tactile animation plays (e.g., checkmark with subtle haptic feedback).
   - Task moves to "Completed" section or fades out, depending on filter.

4. **Step 4**: User navigates via sidebar to filter by category or due date.
   - Sidebar is collapsible, with icons only in collapsed state.

5. **Step 5**: User edits or deletes tasks as needed.
   - Edit in place; delete with confirmation to prevent accidental loss.

6. **Step 6**: All data is instantly saved to local storage; no save button required.

### Advanced Features & Edge Cases
- Power users can use keyboard shortcuts for all major actions (add, complete, filter, navigate).
- If local storage is full or unavailable, user is notified with a clear, non-intrusive message.
- If a user tries to add a duplicate task, a gentle warning is shown.
- Accessibility: All actions are accessible via keyboard and screen reader.

### UI/UX Highlights
- High color contrast and large touch targets for accessibility.
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Zero visual noise: No ads, badges, or unnecessary notifications.
- Subtle, premium animations for all transitions and completions.
- Consistent minimalist theming (light/dark mode toggle).
- Sidebar is always one click away.

## Narrative
Emma is a freelance designer juggling multiple projects and deadlines. She's tried every major task manager, but each one overwhelms her with notifications, integrations, and endless settings. She just wants a tool that lets her capture ideas and see her week at a glance—without the noise.

Emma discovers Zenith. On her first visit, she's greeted by a serene, uncluttered interface. She adds her first task in seconds. As she completes each item, a subtle animation rewards her progress, keeping her motivated. The sidebar lets her filter by project—no distractions, no confusion.

With Zenith, Emma feels in control. She spends less time managing her tasks and more time creating. For the business, Emma's satisfaction means she's likely to recommend Zenith to her peers, fueling organic growth and establishing Zenith as the minimalist's choice for task management.

## Success Metrics

### Tracking Plan
- Task created
- Task completed
- Category created/selected
- Filter applied
- Task edited/deleted
- Sidebar navigation used
- Onboarding completed/dismissed
- App load time and error events

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs
- **Front-end**: Modular, component-based UI for tasks, sidebar, and filters.
- **Data Model**: Tasks with due dates, categories, completion status.
- **Persistence**: Local storage for all user data; abstracted for future cloud sync.
- **Theming**: Support for light/dark mode and high-contrast accessibility.
- **Animations**: Lightweight, performant animation library or custom CSS for feedback.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, screen reader support.

### Integration Points
None for V1. (No third-party integrations or APIs.)

### Data Storage & Privacy
- All data stored locally in browser/device storage.
- No user data leaves the device.
- Clear privacy policy stating no data collection or tracking beyond anonymous usage analytics.

### Scalability & Performance
- Optimized for instant load and response, even with 1,000+ tasks.
